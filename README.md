# Project

With the help of JS I created some functions to make the site more interactive: button scrolling, menu fade animation, sticky navigation with intersection observer API, slider and tabbed component.
In the page can use the search button to find book. This button is connected to the Google Books API by an async function.
In the BookList folder I created an application where I used JS, DOM manipulation, arrow function, local storage.
In the Chat folder is a real time chat app using nodejs, react and socket.io.
